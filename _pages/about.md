Hi, I'm Roger and I am a mechatronics. Currently I am working on MDP consulting on a drone project. I am interested in control algorithm programming and robotics control theory. At present, I am working in a drone software development by making the firmware and hardware. My research is grounded in robotics and computer vision projects in which involve developing autonomous algorithm tasks for robots

I completed my Bachelor of Science in mechatronics at the [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/). I finished my major with a cumilative GPA of 15.874 and ranked on the top 5% (2/46). According to , my grade is equivalent to A+ in the international letter scale.

In my leisure time, I usually like to walk or run alone. Sometimes I like to play videogames with close friends, specially Call of Duty: Warzone.
