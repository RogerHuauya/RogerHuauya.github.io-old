Hi, I'm Roger and I am a mechatronics. Currently I am working on MDP consulting on a drone project. I am interested in control algorithm programming and robotics control theory. At present, I am working in a drone software development by making the firmware and hardware. My research is grounded in robotics and computer vision projects in which involve developing autonomous algorithm tasks for robots

I completed my Bachelor of Science in mechatronics at the [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/). I finished my major with a cumilative GPA of 15.874 and ranked on the top 5% (2/46). According to , my grade is equivalent to A+ in the international letter scale.

During my undergraduate program, I spent almost three years in a research laboratory called LIIARPI (stands for Laboratory of artificial intelligence, robotics and image processing). During this time, I was part of three formative research projects funded by the university.

As part of my commitment to my hemophilia community, I volunteer as a committee member in a non-profit organitation called ASPEH (Asociaci√≥n peruana de hemophilia - Peruvian Association of hemophilia). I manage the official Facebook account of [ASPEH](https://www.facebook.com/AspehPeru) and I am in charge of posting about important events such as online events, related national issues and answering messages from our community. I am also supporting the [official website](https://hemofiliaperu.org/). I am part of a team in which develops plans to organize health seminars about important issues about hemophilia.

In my leisure time, I usually like to walk or run alone. Sometimes I like to play videogames with close friends, specially Call of Duty: Warzone.
