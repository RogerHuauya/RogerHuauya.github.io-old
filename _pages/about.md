Hi, I'm Roger and I am a mechatronics from the [National University of Engineering](https://www.uni.edu.pe/), Currently I am working on MDP consulting on a drone project.

I am interested in control algorithm programming and robotics control theory. At present, I am working in a drone software development by making the firmware and hardware. My research is grounded in robotics and computer vision projects in which involve developing autonomous algorithm tasks for robots
