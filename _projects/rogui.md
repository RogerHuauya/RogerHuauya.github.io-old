This project was developed as part of a passion shared with my friend [Guillermo Inglis](https://github.com/GuillermoInglis). We wanted to do something fun with robotics.

As a result, we decided to design and build a omnidirectional mobile robot with three wheel. Because we were a team of two, we wanted to give our project an original name. That is why we decided to name it **ROGUI** which stands for **RO**ger and **GUI**llermo.

Over this implementation, we seek to find optimal control algorithm to control its movement using reinforcement learning based techiniques to aid the main control algorithm.

Until the beginning of 2020, we achieved to implement the physical robot and an actor critic based control algorithm.
